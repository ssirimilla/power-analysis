**Project for DSC80 at UCSD** <br>

In this project, I analyzed a dataset documenting major power outages in the United States between January 2000 and July 2016. The Department of Energy classifies these events as outages that affected at least 50,000 customers or resulted in an unexpected loss of 300 megawatts or more. The data was obtained from Purdue University’s Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure.

The dataset provides details about each outage along with geographic, climatic, and land-use information, as well as state-level electricity usage and economic indicators.

I wanted to know - what is the relation between hurricanes and power outages? Although I explored many features in my DataFrame, hurricanes has been a coherent theme in my project.
